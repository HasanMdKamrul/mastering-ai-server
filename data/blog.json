    "question": "What is cors?",
    "answer": "Cors states for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Which is basically an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. Cors is also enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. This allows to share the resources or data into any platform such as web,android,ios etc. However, it also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). "

    "question": "What is Node? How does Node work??",
    "answer": "Node JS is the JS runtime environment.Which achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests.which means synchronous and asynchronous workflow.In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.In the server-side node JS works like browsers v8 engines there are a few differences but eventually it converts javascript code into machine code, it is highly scalable, lightweight, fast, and data-intensive."
